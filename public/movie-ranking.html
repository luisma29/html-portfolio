<h1>The Best Movies! (according to Luis)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of the last 3 years.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>
You know how almost every action movie review says:<br />
<h4>"Get ready for edge-of-your-seat action!" when it's pretty much a lie?</h4>
Well, Top Gun Maverick will LITERALLY have you on the edge of your seat!!!<br />
The graphics, the acting, the plot (and plot twists) just make this movie so enjoyable...<br />
I was just as excited watching it the second time around as I was when in the movie theater!

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
Sir Christopher Nolan strikes again. This time, he is bringing the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen.
This is a 3-hour masterpiece that really gives you a fly-on-the-wall perspective of the whole Manhattan project. 
This is a movie for real film buffs and deep thinkers.

<h3>Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio</h3>
<p>
A completely unexpected (for me at least) reimagining of the classic Disney tale.
This movie came out around the same time a live-actino Disney remake of Pinnochio did and del Toro's film blows it out of the water!
